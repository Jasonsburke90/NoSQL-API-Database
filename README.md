# Social Network API Database

## Description

This application is an API for a NoSQL social media database which uses the express.js and Mongoose packages to manage the database. Users can be created, they can share their thoughts, they can react to other users' thoughts, and they can add other users as friends. They can edit their posts and reactions, as well as delete their posts and friendlists. Users can also be deleted. As there is no front end for this API, you'll have to use Thunderclient or another API extension to access the data.
